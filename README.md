Instructions to use our computer prototype:
Firstly, you click the “Home.page.html” file to enter our website, then you see the home page, here you can click “select a school”, and we choose “Northwestern University”. 
Then we come to the homepage of Northwestern University. We can see there is a category list about issues, the log-in button and the “search” function at the top of the webpage. Following them, we can see the “submit a proposal” clearly and more hot topics.
When we click the “Submit your proposal” button, we will see a window popping out to remind us to log in. If I am a student, I just click the “student” option and finish the log-in. Then I click the “Submit your proposal” button again, it directs me to the proposal submitting page. 
Then I enter the proposal, and click “submit” button. Then I can see the reminder of submitted successfully. Then it directs to the page where I can see the details of the proposal. Here I can comment, vote for it and see the process status of it.
